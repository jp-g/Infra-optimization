To create a high-availability DevOps infrastructure for an e-commerce application using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and a configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet, follow these steps:
1. Create an EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer and Elastic IP
Refer to my previous response for detailed steps on creating an EC2 cluster with a load balancer and elastic IP.
2. Automate the Provisioning of EC2 Instances
Choose a configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the provisioning of EC2 instances. For example, with Ansible, you can create a playbook to define the desired state of your instances and use the AWS EC2 module to manage them8
.
3. Install Docker and Kubernetes on the Cluster
Install Docker on each EC2 instance to run your application in containers6
. Then, set up a Kubernetes cluster using a tool like kops or eksctl to manage your containerized application6
.
4. Implement Network Policies
Create network policies in Kubernetes to allow ingress traffic from the front-end application pod to the database pod. This ensures that only authorized traffic can access the database6
.
5. Create a New User with Pod Management Permissions
Create a new Kubernetes user with the necessary permissions to create, list, get, update, and delete pods. You can use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define the user's permissions6
.
6. Configure Application on the Pod
Deploy your e-commerce application on Kubernetes using a combination of deployments, services, and other Kubernetes resources. Ensure that your application is properly configured to communicate with the database and other required services6
.
7. Take Snapshot of ETCD Database
Set up regular snapshots of the ETCD database to ensure data durability and enable disaster recovery6
.
8. Set Auto-Scaling Criteria
Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale your application based on CPU and memory usage. Set the criteria so that if the memory or CPU usage goes beyond 50%, the number of pods will automatically scale up6
. By following these steps, you can create a high-availability infrastructure for your e-commerce application using AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and a configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.
